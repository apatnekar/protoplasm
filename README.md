In this project we designed and developed a Compiler for Java-like object oriented language, which compiles the source program into target MIPS assembly program.

The Compiler is developed in Python and is designed to compile some of the features of Object oriented languages like Classes, methods, inheritance, object creation, arrays, etc.
